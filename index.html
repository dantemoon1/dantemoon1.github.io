        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Dante Moon!</h1>
				<p>I am a computer science student at California State University Monterey Bay, where I am working on degree concentrations in data science and software engineering.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>In the last two years I have completed internships in data science at <a href="https://www.linqia.com/" target = "_blank">Linqia</a> and bizOps at <a href="https://www.shift.com/" target = "_blank">Shift</a>.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Before starting at CSUMB I spent three years working in ops for <a href="https://www.shift.com/" target = "_blank">Shift</a>, an online platform that leverages technology to transform the car buying process. </p>
